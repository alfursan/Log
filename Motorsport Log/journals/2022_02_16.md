	- Contacted Belhasa, Drive Dubai & Sharjah Driving institute.
	- Only Sharjah Driving institute decided to take a look at our proposal. Belhasa didn't answer. Drive Dubai said no because of previous issues while sponsoring events in BITS.
	- Peugeot was contacted today, but there was no answer.
	- Contacted Priyank sir today and fixed a meeting with him on Monday 9:30am. Topic is to decide which CSR cause our team can take up. The whole core team was informed as they should join the meeting as well. This can help improve sponsorship calls. As even BMW rejected the proposal saying they are moving completely to electric vehicles and calls for sustainability.
