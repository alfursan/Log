	- I have contacted SellAnyCar.com,  Ducab, Redbull again (This time contact name Beqa via the email they gave us), personal email address of Wurth Tools, Coca-Cola & NSV Auto were given, I have sent them mails regarding sponsorship too.
	- [[Elais]] contacted me back  on behalf of Anas Hamdan (Area Manager) whose mail I have sent to. He seems interested and will tell us when he can meet us for seeing the current condition of the car to see if he can sponsor us.
	- [[Surya]] has contacted Idealz and sent them email as well, Garima has contacted Toyota.
	- We are currently having little luck. Even with the change of approach to Corporate Social Responsibility funds because the companies respond back saying funds can't be allocated from that because of covid financial situation.
	- But [[Wurth]] contacted us back because of the barter system for the tool kit, hopefully that should go well.
