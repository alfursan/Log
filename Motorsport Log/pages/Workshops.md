- # Idea
  background-color:: #533e7d
	- In order to ==raise funds==, we could host workshops for students
	- like what ACM does
- ## Feasibility
  background-color:: #497d46
	- However, we need to evaluate the opportunity cost
	- we need to prepare a lot cuz people are paying money
	- time
	- energy
	- alternative activities
	- Alsooo will people actually pay??
- # Survey
  background-color:: #49767b
	- Figure out
		- **how many** are interested
		- **what** are they interested in
		- **how much** are they willing to pay
	- Questions have to be determined
	- GForms + GSheets + GDataStudio
- # Pricing
  background-color:: #793e3e
	- free for motorsports members
	- $x$ amount for others - to be determined
	- note that this is an **elastic commodity**, so decrease in price will increase the revenue; refer to economics notes on elasticity
	- ```calc
	  price = 10
	  n = 20
	  
	  total = price * n
	  ```
