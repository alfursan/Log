- # Misc guidelines for the team
  background-color:: #264c9b
	- Be polite and respectful with everyone
		- Team spirit is very important
	- Instead of thinking all of this as work, think of this as an outlet of your passion
	- Everyone should have 5 new pieces of work with them at any time
		- work could mean text content, idea, design, whatever
		- this is to ensure that you can stay calm, in case of a creative drought
	- Every once in a while just check the team log to keep updated with the progress of the entire team
		- no one is gonna force, but it's good to know what is happening outside of your team as well
- # Hierarchy

	- It is implied that Thahir **can** help out, but mainly I'm in on-site team under anirudh
	- Website is not the priority right now
- # Communication
  background-color:: #497d46
  id:: 61f64424-45e0-443e-b1ad-75b27ce77083
	- ## Private
		- if something concerns just 2 people, just clear it out on private chat
		- for example, if anyone just wants to discuss with Thahir about some design, feel free to send a private message
	- ## Groupchats
		- ==**please avoid spam**== because if there is something actually important, it's hard to find it
			- even I myself haven't followed this so far, i'll accept that
		- If a message is expecting of a reply, don't just seen-zone it ... Put üëç
		- ### Inter-team
			- main whatsapp group with everyone in #Creative team
			- only major updates concerning everyone should be sent here
		- ### Intra-team
			- [[Anmol]] will be in each of them and only he will report to [[Thahir]] about daily updates
	- ## Comments
		- small comments to be discussed on intra-team group
		- if the discussion leads to a conclusion
		  (such as: the font should be changed)
			- these comments should be added on google drive, so that the issues can be tracked
				- if you've got any doubts on how to add comments, [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1imMM-s4VihLR0a2_zKBEGccZOCBBo6kV/view)
			- once the change has been made
				- the designer will re-upload the file with the ==same name==
					- so that the comments and highlights will remain
				- and then click 'resolved' to mark it as done
	- ## Log
	  [Click Here](https://ahmedthahir.github.io/MotorsportBPDC/Export/)
		- This log has the daily workings of the team
		- Only report the big updates for the documentation
			- Otherwise it is gonna get messy
		- If you have something to report, message [[Anmol]]
- # Workflow
  background-color:: #787f97
	- ## Photos
		- On-site crew gets pictures, footage
		- Editors pick their favorites and start working on them
	- ## Videos
		- Filming
		  I am going for more of a run-and-gun look, so I'm trying to keep it pretty minimal; otherwise, filming might get clunky
			- A Cam

			  isn't meant to be moving around; it's just so change the angle every once-in-a-while to ensure that the video doesn't seem boring

		- Editing
			- Davinci Resolve
	- ## Educational Content
		- Shobal gives educational content
		- Designer converts that content into a pretty post
	- Social Media Manager uploads
		- **Suggestion**: the social media manager can also have a fake account where they see how uploads would appear
		- this way we can match the grid and stuff
		- idk for sure, just a suggesion
- # Organization
  background-color:: #978626
	- we have unlimited drive storage, so don't worry
	- make sure you strictly follow this to avoid future complications with finding stuff
	- everything should be uploaded on every person's corresponding GDrive folder
		- Personal Sub-Folders
			- Create some kind of folder structure that you're comfortable with
			- For eg, I name the folder as the date I got the idea for the design
